## Context
Terminal applications, also known as command line applications, are run from the shell and accept input from [stdin]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)") and arguments such as flags and options, and produce an output that is useful to the user.

You will create your own terminal app because:

- terminal applications are an essential part of learning to utilise the functions of all operating systems efficiently and in a way that promotes your understanding of the inner workings and processes of operating systems and the hardware itself;
- many applications used across IT functions utilise terminal applications as a standard, rather than applications with a graphical user interface;
- developing your own terminal application will increase your technical sophistication and ability to use other terminal applications.

## Project Brief
You are to design, implement and test a terminal application and throughout the process demonstrate that you are able to use a range of developer tools.

The mandatory requirements/constraints for your application are:

- it must utilise arguments that can be provided in the terminal when running the application (args, options and flags)
- accept user input in the form of a file or text input
- produce printed output or interact with the file system

*You must consult with your educator on the application you intend to make before completing substantial work on the software development plan or implementing the application itself.*
